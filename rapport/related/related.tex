\subsection{Raspberry PI Beowulf cluster}
A lot of the inspiration to create a Raspberry PI cluster came from reading a report on a Beowulf cluster project from Boise State University.\cite{RPI_BEOWULF} In this project the performance of 32 Raspberry PI nodes put up against a node running an 3.1GHz Intel Xeon E3-1225 quad-core processor and 8GB of RAM. Along with comparing performance under parallel computing, they also had a look on power consumption. It will be interesting to see if we achieve comparable results.
