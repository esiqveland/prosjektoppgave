In this section we will explore related work on the area.
\subsection{Raspberry PI Beowulf cluster}
A lot of the inspiration to create a Raspberry PI cluster came from reading a report on a Beowulf cluster project from Boise State University.\cite{RPI_BEOWULF} In this project the performance of 32 Raspberry PI nodes put up against a node running an 3.1GHz Intel Xeon E3-1225 quad-core processor and 8GB of RAM. Along with comparing performance under parallel computing, they also had a look on power consumption. It will be interesting to see if we achieve comparable results. 

\subsection{FAWN: A Fast Array of Wimpy Nodes}
FAWN\cite{fawn} aims to reduce the energy consumption of cost-effective clusters with data-intensive workloads. By combining low-power efficient CPUs, flash storage, balancing computation and I/O capabilities they were able to provide energy-efficient massively parallel access to data. 
Through their work they were able to provide roughly 350 queries per Joule which is 2 orders of magnitude more than traditional disk-based systems at the time.
