TODO

ideas:














overclock:
to verify overclock is working, read current cpu clock from this file:
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq


setup:
inkludere en tegning av nettverksoppsett.


future work:
try out nodes for indexing work, lots of IO, but too much cpu? Map reduce does not seem to perform well on pis, at least with hadoop.\ref
