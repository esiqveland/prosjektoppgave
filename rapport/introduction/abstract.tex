In this project we have taken taken a look on how a cluster of Raspberry Pi computers perform when tasked with providing a search engine with regards to energy efficiency. We have built a cluster of eight nodes as well as the high powered USB hub required to run it. We have measured throughput and power consumption and compared performance and energy efficiency to that of a MacBook Pro running Core i5 and flash storage.

We have written the search engine as well as the programs needed to balance load and generate traffic. All code running on the Raspberry Pis is written in C for optimal performance.

Through our implementation and testing we have found that our relatively cheap system achieves comparable results with a newer MacBook Pro with regards to energy efficiency and performance at lower work loads. It also shows promising results at peak load, but our workload proved too CPU bound to explore this fully.
