In this project we have taken taken a look on how a cluster of Raspberry Pi computers perform when tasked with providing a search engine with regards to energy efficiency. We have built a cluster of eight nodes as well as the high powered USB hub required to run it. We have measured throughput and power consumption and compared performance and energy efficiency to that of a MacBook Pro running Core i5 and flash storage.

We have written the search engine as well as the programs needed to balance load and generate traffic. All code running on the Raspberry Pis is written in C for optimal performance.

Through our implementation and testing we have found that our relatively cheap system achieves comparable results with a newer MacBook Pro with regards to energy efficiency and performance at lower work loads. At peak load however, the small computers can not keep up in neither workload nor power efficiency. The Raspberry Pis showed a peak efficiency of 350 queries per Joule when overclocked, where as the i5 maxed out at about 710 queries per Joule for 1 core, and 842 for max load on 2 cores.
