\section{Abstract}
Energy consumption and the corresponding heat dissipation in becoming a considerable challenge in computer centers and super computers. Today most large scale computers use powerful multi core CPUs and have tens if not hundreds of gigabytes of RAM. In addition to being very expensive up front in the acquisition there is also a lot of cost associated with operating these computers. We don't have to look any further than the IBM produced Roadrunner which while still being the 22nd fastest computer in the world, was shut down in March 2013 because it was no longer worth the power bill related to operating it.\cite{roadrunner}

Much research today is related to making computers more power efficient. Intels Haswell micro architecture brings significant enhancements in laptop efficiency. However these improvements are related to saving power by slowing down the cores whenever theres lack of work. Another interesting area is the mobile processors. ARM processors are very light weight and typically run very efficiently. These cores are simpler and a lot slower than traditional CPUs, however they are very cheap. There has been some research in the use of clusters containing multiple of these ARM computers and performing normal cluster tasks. In this project we have made a cluster of 8 Raspberry PI computers and use them to process queries over a set of documents.
