\section{Summary}
In this project we have taken taken a look on how a cluster of Raspberry PI computers perform when tasked with providing a search engine. We have built a cluster as well as the high powered USB hub required to run it. We have measured throughput and power consumption and compared this to a MacBook Pro.

We have written the search engine as well as the programs needed to balance load and generate traffic. All code running on the Raspberry PIs is written in C for optimal performance.

Through our implementation and testing we have found that even though our system lacks in performance and is relatively cheap, it achieves comparable results with a newer MacBook Pro.
