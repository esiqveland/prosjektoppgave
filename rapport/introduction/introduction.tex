\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This section discusses the background for our project, what goals we have and the method we employed to reach our goals. This report is structured in 

Section \ref{sec:related} briefly explores related work. 
In Section \ref{sec:hardware}, we introduce the properties of the hardware we will be using, and look at alternatives.
Section \ref{sec:software} explains the software we have built for this project as well as configuration of the nodes.
Section \ref{sec:build} shows how we built the hardware of the system we will be using as well as the structure for that holds our cluster.
Section \ref{sec:experiments} contains experiments we ran on the cluster as well as the corresponding the results and discussion.
Section \ref{sec:conclusion} contains our conclusion as well as further work that could be applied to the cluster.

\subsection{Background}
Small single board system on chip computers are getting increasingly popular. They are tiny, low powered and cheap. But do they pack a punch? And can they be used for as traditional cluster computers?
How would a set of these low energy devices compare up to an ordinary laptop computer if we take energy consumption, performance into account, and can they be used for cost efficiently scaling a system to different workloads?

In this report we will try to answer this. Our focus will be on delivering query results from a search system, stressing the two likely slowest parts of the PI\:
It's disk access and network.

\subsection{Goals}
In this project we have several questions we want to answer:
\begin{enumerate}
\item How does a cluster of Raspberry Pi nodes compare to a MacBook Pro running i5?
\item Can we scale our cluster efficiently?
\end{enumerate}

Throughout the project we will try to find answers for these questions.

\subsection{Method}
We will build a cluster of Raspberry PIs including a custom power supply. We will implement our own search system modifying code from the exercises of CS3245 Information Retrieval (National University of Singapore). To benchmark our system we will write a load generator to generate queries for our system to answer. We will also measure power consumption and compare these results with a MacBook Pro.
