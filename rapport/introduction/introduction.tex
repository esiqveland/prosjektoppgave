\section{Introduction}
This section discusses the background for our project and the goals and means we chose for executing this.
\subsection{Background}
Small single board system on chip computers is getting increasingly popular. They are tiny, low powered and cheap. But do they pack a punch?
How would a set of these low energy devices compare up to an ordinary desktop computer if we take energy consumption and performance into account.
\subsection{Goals}
To explore the possibilities of more power efficient clusters.
\subsection{Method}
Use a home made search system, and use a load generator to test the system
