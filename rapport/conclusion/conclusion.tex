\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future}
For future work it would be interesting to see more IO intensive workloads used, such as those employed by Andersen et al.\cite{fawn} or loads from a larger corpus that does not fit in RAM.
Our cold read results from Section \ref{sec:coldread}, that are more like random access reads, show a much closer gap between our and the reference system compared to the other work conditions we tested, and seem to warrant further work.

It would also be interesting to explore some intensive data manipulation work, such as MapReduce type operations. There has been done some work on the area by one enthusiast who made a Java based Hadoop suite.\cite{hadoop} However he mentions challenges working around the limited RAM of the Raspberry Pis.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Our system shows that for low intensity CPU workloads, small embedded hardware could provide energy efficient massive parallel reads, even within an order of magnitude of modern day SSDs.
For our system, we managed to serve queries at a rate of 350 queries per Joule, where as the modern day dual core i5 with a high cost SSD ended up at 842 queries per Joule.
This shows that there is potential for disk heavy access work being handled by these nodes, however, if work turns towards the CPU intensive, our system quickly loses its usefulness.
