\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future}
For future work it would be interesting to see more IO intensive workloads used, such as those employed by Andersen et al.\cite{fawn} or from a larger corpus that nowhere near can fit in RAM.
Our cold read results from Section \ref{sec:coldread}, that are more like random access reads, show a very close gap compared to the other work environments we tested, and seem to warrant further work.
For further work we would like to run more IO focused operations to see if we can reproduce their findings with an ARM based CPU, as theirs were X86 based.

It would also be interesting to explore some intensive data manipulation work, such as MapReduce type operations.
Work has been done on this, but it was for the Java based Hadoop suite, which these machines seem a little too small for with the limited amount of memory, and the results are reflecting this.
