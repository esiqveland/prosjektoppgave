These queries are of varying length and contains a subset of the tokens found in the dictionary. It also includes some tokens not found in the dictionary.

\subsection{Optimized C-port}
In practice we experienced serious performance issues with our python code, often showing response times in the hundreds of milliseconds. We therefore decided to rewrite the program using C. This also proved useful to control what exactly is present in memory at every moment, in addition to the extra work of having to control memory allocation.
